This is a node.js server app which interacts with a PostgreSQL relational database to display
information about movies.

The main application is started by running node \app\app.js

It uses a Model-View-Controller paradigm. It features middleware and helpers to handle cookies,
sessions and authentication.

The Database is generated by running the scripts 1 through 4 in the \database folder.

The Database is populated by a combination of real data from The Open Movie Database, some
fake users for interesting data points as well as some randomly generated dummy values. See the node script \database\populate\populate.js

The Populate script fetches information from The Open Movie Database and generates the Populate.sql file.

The example queries are written in \database\queries.sql but unfortunately we did not have time to implement them on the website.

The front end of the website is based on Bootstrap and is found under \frontend
